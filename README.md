# OOP + JDBC + PostgreSQL (E-commerce Demo)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **console-based Java application** that demonstrates the use of  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles together with **JDBC** to work with a  
**PostgreSQL database**.

The project simulates a simplified **e-commerce system**, where:
- shoppers (customers) are stored in the database
- products are stored in the database
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed via Java
